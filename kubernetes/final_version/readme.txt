This is the final version of my app. It is using:
.Golang
.Bootstrap 4
.HTML
.CSS
.TEMPLATES
.JSON
.YAML FILES
.MONGODB
.Docker
.Kubernetes with Persisten Volume Claim 
(the best way to attach persistent storage to a pod is to only create the PVC (with an explicitly specified storage-
ClassName if necessary) and the pod (which refers to the PVC by name). Everything
else is taken care of by the dynamic PersistentVolume provisioner)
