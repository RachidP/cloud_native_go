Her a example how to use mongo db with golang
I did CRUD operation with mongodb and I tested a lot functions.

You can find some alternative working solution 's for 
.adding data  //insertOneDocument1()
.get all data //getAllDocument2() and getAllDocument3()


N.B: Be VERY careful when you update a document. The key must be exactly equal to The
key in the DB, otherwise You will add a new's key to the document. so the
shape of the document will change
